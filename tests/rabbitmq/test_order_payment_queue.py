This test simulates the publishing of a full payment payload by the Order Service.
It verifies that the message is received correctly in the RabbitMQ queue intended
for the Payment Service.

Assumptions:
    - Default RabbitMQ exchange is used.
    - Routing key equals queue name (direct publishing).
