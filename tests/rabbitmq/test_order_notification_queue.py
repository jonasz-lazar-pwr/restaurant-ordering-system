"""Integration test: Order Service â†’ Notification Queue (RabbitMQ).

This test simulates the publishing of order status update messages by the Order Service.
It verifies that each message is correctly received in the notification service queue.

Assumptions:
    - Messages are sent via the default RabbitMQ exchange.
    - Routing key equals queue name (direct-to-queue delivery).
